    <h3>The look of Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft, a fictional female character who has been criticised extensively in the past for her scantily-clad demeanour, has started to evolve in a more body-positive way. Designed in the 1990s with unrealistic proportions, modern iterations of the character are finally beginning to be more representative of a real human.</h3>

  <h6> Stereotypes and Clichés </h6>
  <h4> The way female characters are designed and depicted has often been sexualised and derogatory, drawn with exaggerated figures and minimal clothing, or falling victim to harassment and violation in games such as Grand Theft Auto Five.<br>Even non-human characters are often hit with “girly” stereotypes; a recent redesign of Sheila, a female kangaroo in the new Spyro Reignited Trilogy game, gives the character a nipped-in waist, glamorous eyelashes and a new hairdo. This went on to spark a social media backlash with critics questioning why a cartoon kangaroo needed to look “sexy”.</h4></div>

    <h3>Female character representation in video games is lacking with only 5% of video games showcasing female protagonists. Various studies reveals that gender stereotypes continue to prevail in video games, with female characters often objectified and hypersexualized.  And when not depicted in this manner, female characters are often portrayed as a love interest, innocent or needing to be rescued by a male character.</h3>
