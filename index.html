      <h3> The mission of Girls Who Game is to encourage a just and safe space- <br> at work, at home, and at heart. GWG encourages women and minorities to <br> work in the gaming industry in order to change the typical numbers in <br> the field. We want to change the overall portrayal of women in games <br> and the treatment of the women who play those games. Together, we can raise <br> awareness of these things and take the steps towards change. <br><img src="assets/ht.png" alt="hashtag girls who code"></h3>
